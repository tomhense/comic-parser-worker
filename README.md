# Comic RSS Generator worker
This is the source code for a cloudflare worker which generates rss feeds for certain comics. This project was more of an exercise to me on how to use cloudflare workers, how to webscrape using them and how to generate rss feeds using them. Cloudflare workers are bit restrictive and webscraping was a little bit of a challange using them. I don't recommend using this but maybe it is a useful resource to someone.

### Currently supported comics
- Safely Endangered
- The Jenkins Comic
